# Challenge 12: Employee Manager

## Description

This project is an Employee Manager that uses inquirer and mysql to manipulate tables from a database. It consists of a main menu made from inquirer in the command line, and uses a series of prompts that allow the user to add and change the tables of the employees_db database. This project was fun and gives me a better idea of how to go in and out of a database.

## Installation

## Usage

To start, make sure to have the inquirer and mysql configured by putting 'npm install' in the command line. Be sure to enter mysql and source the schema and run the seeds file.
After, run 'node index.js' and the menu prompt should show. From here, there are 7 options to manage employees, and a quit option to stop the program. Users can add employees, departments, and roles, as well as view all employees, departments, and roles. The user can also update an employees role.
